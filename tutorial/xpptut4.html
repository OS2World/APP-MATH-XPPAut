<h1> <a name="start"> V. Beyond 2 dimensions</a> </h1>
<p> We have considered planar dynamical systems and if you have done
the homework, you have explored some aspects of homoclinic orbits,
bifurcations, and stability.  The appearance of limit cycles through
Hopf bifurcations, etc, is not restricted to planar systems.  For
example, an analysis similar to what we did with the <a
href=xpptut3.html#lecar> Morris-Lecar </a> model can be done with the
<a href=newstyle.html#hh> Hodgkin-Huxley equations </a> a 4
dimensional dynamical system.  In this part of the tutorial, we will
explore some other features of XPP.  We will see how to use XPP to
find the phase interaction function for weakly coupled oscillators.
We will also study period doubling bifurcations, Poincare sections,
and discrete dynamical systems.  This is where we generally have to
rely most heavily on numerical methods.  
<h2> <a name=average> Averaging and weakly coupled oscillators: Phase
models
 </a> </h2>
When a system of differential equations has a stable limit cycle
solution, one is often interested in the behavior when several such
systems are coupled together.  One of the main ideas in dynamical
systems is to consider situations where the behavior of an uncoupled
system can tell you something about the coupled system.  Thus, we can
ask what happens when two or more limit cycle oscillators are coupled
together.  This is generally an impossible question to answer, but
there are cases when a great deal can be said.  In particular, if the
coupling between the two systems is small enough so as to not disrupt
the repetitive activity too much.  The idea is illustrated below:
<p> <a name=torus>
<center> <img src=gif/torus.gif> </center> </a> </p>
That is, in absence of coupling, one can describe the state of an
oscillator by its phase or position on its cycle. (Imagine the limit
cycle as a flexible loop which we then deform into a circle.) Two
uncoupled limit cycles can be described by a pair of phase
coordinates.  Since phases are on a circle, the pair of phases lies on
a torus.  Now if the limit cycles are stable, then when they are
"weakly" coupled, the torus persists.  The <b> method of averaging
</b> tells us that the phases satisfy a very simple pair of
differential equations:
<p> <center> <a name=phseq> <img src=gif/phase.gif></a> </center> <p>
 XPP has several useful features for dealing with 
 I show some of the features that XPP has
for dealing with these <a href=xppphase.html> <b> phase
equations. </b></a>   <p>
The main task at hand is to compute the phase interaction function.
XPP gives you a very powerful tool for numerically computing the phase
interaction function.  But, first, to understand how to use this
feature in XPP, I must once again go into <a href=gif/mathmode.gif>
math mode. </a> <p>
Suppose we have a system that is zipping along nicely on its limit
cycle.  Then at a particular phase in its cycle, we perturb one of
the component quantities.  This results in a small timing change in
the oscillator, a <b> phase shift. </b>  <p>
<p>
<center> <img src=gif/prc.gif> </center> <p>
The phase shift that results
will depend on  both the component of the limit cycle that was
perturbed and the time in the cycle at which the perturbation occured.
In the limit that the perturbations become infinitesimally small, this
phase shift function tends to a computable vector quantity called the
<b> adjoint </b> or <b> response function. </b>  Each component of the
adjoint gives the phase shift that results from administering a
perturbation of the corresponding component in the limit cycle at the
corresponding time of its cycle.  Call this function <b>Z(t).</b> If
the basic limit cycle in <i> n </i> dimensional so is <i> Z(t). </i>
<p>
Suppose we couple two identical oscillators <i> X1'=F(X1) </i> and <i>
X2'=F(X2) </i> 
with weak coupling <i> epsilon G1(X2,X1) </i>:
<p>
<center> <img src=gif/couple.gif> </center> <p>
Then, the interaction function <i> which depends only on the
phase-difference </i> is computed by averaging the effect of the
coupling with the response function or adjoint:
<p>
 <center>  <img src=gif/average.gif> </center> <p>
<p>
With this bit of stuff out of the way, it is clear what has to be
done. After computing a limit cycle, the adjoint must be computed.
Then the average of this must be computed.  XPP provides simple steps
for doing that which we will illustrate by starting with the <a
href=xpptut3.html#lecar> Morris-Lecar equations </a> and adding a
synapse function which will serve to define a synaptic activity.

<h3> <a name=reduction> Computing the response and interaction
function for an oscillator </a> </h3>

  We will confine our attention to a three-dimensional model of a
neuron with a synapse.
(Two dimensions for the dynamics of the membrane and one for the
synapse; coupling two of them will then be six-dimensions.  The
reduction we perform here makes this into a 2 dimensional system.)
We thus use the Morris-Lecar model and add an equation for the
synaptic activation:
<p> <center> <a href=odes/ml_syn.ode> <img src=gif/synapse.gif></a> </center> </p>
Here <a href=gif/alpha.gif> <tt> alpha </tt> </a> and 
<a href=gif/betta.gif> <tt> beta </tt> </a>  
determine the rise and fall time of the synapse.
Now we will solve this equation along with the
Morris-Lecar equations
for a choice of parameters that gives nice oscillations for the
membrane. (<a href=newstyle.html#mlsyn> View the source? </a>)  <p>
Having fired up XPP, we can integrate the equations several times to
get on a nice limit cycle.  Click <a href=xppnum.html#timestuff>
(U)(T) </a> to set the total integration
time to 46.9 which is about the period.  The idea is to get just one
period of the limit cycle in the browser.  Click (D) to set <tt>
DeltaT </tt> to 0.1 which will speed things up a bit. 
Click (Esc) to get back to
the main menu and then click <a href=xppmain.html#ics> (I) (G) </a> to
integrate the equations.  In the ode file I have set the initial data
on the limit cycle.  Click <a href=xppmain.html#xivst> (X) and type in
V </a> to plot the voltage versus time.  Click (I)(L) twice to
integrate the equations twice more strating at the values the previous
integration left them. The graphs should almost superimpose showing
you have a good estimate of the period. (<em> NOTE: </em>  How did I
find the period?  Here is how I do it:  Integrate for a while to get
several periods.  Then use the <a href=xppbrowse.html> data viewer
</a> to find the times between peaks of the voltage and use this as
the period.) <p>
Now we are ready to compute the response function.  Click <a
href=xppnum.html#average> (U) (A) </a> to bring up the
adjoint/averaging menu.  This menu allows you to compute the response
function <b> Z(t) </b> and the interaction function <b> H(phi) </b>
for arbitrary oscillators.  <em> You must first compute a response
function or adjoint before computing an H function. </em>   <p>
Click (N) to begin the calculation of the new adjoint. It should not
take long.  Click (Esc) to get to the main menu and then click (X)
(Enter) to plot "V" versus t.  XPP has replaced the periodic orbit
with the components of the adjoint or response function.   You should
see something like 
<p>
<center> <img src=gif/adj.gif> </center> <p>
although there may be a phase shift.  If the colors look wrong, it was
probably in the food you ate.   You can switch between the <b>
periodic orbit </b> and the <b> adjoint </b> by clicking (U) to get to
the numerics menu and then (A) to get the adjoint menu and choosing
(A) or (O) for the adjoint or orbit respectively. Then with a click of
(Esc) go back to the main menu and plot with the (X) click. If you
want you can look at the other components of the adjoint. (Note that
the "s" component is zero as the synapse has no effect on the <em>
presynaptic </em> cell.) <p>
We now want to compute the interaction function.  This assumes that we
couple two identical cells.  Let <b> X, Y,  </b> be the vector
components of the two oscillators.  Let the <b> G(X,Y) </b> be the
coupling of cell <b> Y </b> to <b> X. </b> Like <b> X, G </b> is also
a vector with components, <em> g1,g2,... </em> Thus, to compute the
interaction function, we must tell XPP each of the components of the
coupling function.  XPP knows the names of the variables for the
oscillator <b> X </b> so how do we tell it the names for <b> Y </b>?
The names are the same as for <b> X </b> but have primes attached to
them.  Thus if <tt> V </tt> is then name of one component in <b> X
</b> then <tt> V' </tt> is the name of the corresponding component in
<b> Y. </b>   Thus the three components of <b> G </b> are:
<pre>
s'*(Vsyn - V)
0
0
</pre>
That is the <tt> s </tt> component of the <b> Y </b> oscillator
influences the <tt> V </tt> component of <b> X </b> oscillator. 
 All other components of <b> G </b> are
zero.  <p>
So, assuming you have the Numerics menu on the window (if not
click (U) from the main window) click on (A) to get the adjoint menu
and then click on (M) to <b> make </b> an interaction or <b> H </b>
function.  In the command line you will be asked for the three
components of the coupling. You should type in the above expressions
for the three components.  Then after a bit of time XPP will beep to
say it is done.  (On slow computers this can take a bit. It takes 2-3
seconds on the HP and about 10 on my laptop.)  Click (Esc) and then
(X) and type in <tt> V </tt> to plot the interaction function.  XPP
has replaced the first component of the orbit with the interaction
function.  The odd part of the interaction function appears in the
second component of the orbit and the even part replaces the third
component of the orbit (if there is one.)  Plot "w" versus time and
note that it is very close to a sine function.  Plot "s" versus time
and see that it is close to a cosine function plus a constant.  This
observation suggests that we may be able to approximate the
interaction function very simply as 
<p> <center> <img src=gif/happrox.gif> </center> <p>
How do we find the coefficients?  Since <em> H </em> is periodic, that
means it has a Fourier series so we can try to get the Fourier
coefficients.  One standard way to get Fourier coefficients is the <b>
FFT </b> however, that is limited to data that has <em> 2^n </em>
points.  XPP computes the Fourier coefficients the way you would by
just integrating. Since we generally only want the first few, this is
not really slow.  Certainly, it is no slower than computing the
interaction function, <em> H. </em>   Assuming you still have the <em>
H </em> function in the browser, get to the nUmerics menu and click on
<a href=xppnum.html#stoch> (stocHastic) </a>  and then <a
href=xppnum.html#fourier> (Fourier) </a> to compute the Fourier
coefficients of whatever is in the browser.  You will be prompted for
the number of modes (10 is the default and is fine for this) and for
the variable.  Choose <tt> V </tt> since that is the column in the
browser that holds the <em> H </em> function.  In a second or two XPP
beeps and if you look in the Data Browser, you will see 10 rows of
numbers.  The first column is the mode (0-10 in this case), the second
is the cosine coefficient and the third is the sine coefficient.  If
you did this correctly, you should get roughly: 
<pre>
0  202    0
1 -298  239
2   29  -30
3   26   1.7
 .......
</pre>
As our intuition told us 90% of the power is in the first 2 terms, so
by dividing by 300 (a nice round number) we get <em> a0=.667, a1=-.98,b1=.8174
</em> as our approximate H scaled by 1/300.  <p>

In fact, it is fun to compare the real <em> H </em> with the
approximate.  
<ul>
<li> Click on (nUmerics) (stocHastic) and then on (Data) to
get the orbit back.  (You haven't lost the <em> H </em> function so
don't despair.)  
<li> Now in the browser, click on (Add co) to add a new
column. At the prompt, name it <tt> Happrox </tt> and for the formula,
insert <tt> 202-298*cos(2*pi*t/46.9)+239*sin(2*pi*t/46.9) </tt> and
click (Enter). 
<li> Next, plot <tt> happrox </tt> versus time.  Click
(XivsT) in the main XPP menu and type in <tt> happrox. </tt> Now <a
href=xppfreeze.html> freeze it </a> by clicking (Graphics) (Freeze)
(Freeze) and then filling <tt> key </tt> entry of the window  with
<tt> Happrox. </tt>  
<li> Now click (nUmerics) (Adjoint) (H) to load the
browser with the <em> real H </em> function. Click (Esc) to get back
to the main window.  
<li> Finally, click (Xivst) and enter <tt> V </tt> to see the two
compared.
</ul>
If you did this right you will see a pretty good match:

<a name=identical> <h3> Symmetrically coupled oscillators </h3> </a>
A special case of coupling is when both oscillators are coupled
symmetrically.  Then <em> H1 = H2 </em> and we can write a very simple
equation for the phase-difference between the two oscillators.  Recall
the the <a href=#phseq> phase equations </a> derived from averaging
satisfy a very simple set of differential equations that depend only
on the phase difference <em> theta_1 - theta_2. </em> In fact, we can
exploit this and write an equation for the phase-difference, <em> phi
= theta_2-theta_1. </em>  <p>
<center> <a name=phi> <img src=gif/phi.gif> </a> </center> <p>
A fixed point of this equation means that the phase-difference between
the two oscillators is fixed and we say they are <b> phaselocked. </b>
If the interaction functions are identical as for symmetrically
coupled oscillators, then <em> g </em> is the <b> odd part </em> of
the interaction function.  This is why XPP computes the odd part of
the interaction function: <em> the zeros tell you the phase-locked
solutions; those for which <b> g has a positive slope are stable </b>
and those for which <b> g has a negative slope are unstable </b> </em>
<p> 
For the present case, there are two roots to the odd part. (Look at
the <tt> w </tt> component of the H function -- click (nUmerics)
(Adjoint) (Hfun) (Esc) (Xi vs t) <tt> w </tt> (Enter) to see it.) One
of the roots is 0, or <b> synchronous </b> firing of the neural
oscillators and the other is half a cycle a way or <b>
anti-phase. </b> For this model synchrony is stable and anti-phase is
unstable.  The homework below shows other interesting behaviors.
<p> 
<a name=hw3.1> <h3> Homework 3.1 </h3> </a> 
<ol>
<li>Change <tt> Vsyn </tt> from 120 to -75 to make it an inhibitory
synapse and compute <em> H </em>  Since this only changes the coupling
and not the dynamics, it is not necessary to recompute the orbit or
the adjoint. If coupling is symmetric what are the stable phase-locked
solutions. Does coupling speed up or slow down the oscillations? 
<li> Change <tt> Vsyn </tt> to 0 mV a more realistic value and again
compute the interaction function.  What are the stable phase-locked
states in this case for symmetrically coupled oscillators?
<li> Compute the interaction function for <em> diffusively coupled
</em> oscillators. The components for coupling are
<pre>
 v'-v
0
0  
</pre>
What are the stable phase-locked states for this type of coupling?
<li> Set the following parameters <tt> V3=12, V4=8, I=40 </tt> Compute
the periodic orbit.  Find the response function and note that it is
almost strictly positive.  Compute the interaction function for
<tt> Vsyn=120 and Vsyn=-75 </tt>  and find all the phase-locked states
for symmetrically coupled oscillators.
<li> Use the same model for the synapse with <tt> alpha=5 , beta=.5
</tt> on the <a href=newstyle.html#hh> Hodgkin-Huxley </a> equations
with <tt> I=20 </tt> Compute the interaction function for <tt>
Vsyn=50, Vsyn=0, Vsyn=-70 </tt> and again when the time-constant of
the synapse is slowed to <tt> beta=.05. </tt>  Find all pahse-locked
solutuions and their stability.  (You will have to write an ODE file
yourself: copy the HH file and add the synaptic equations to it; use
the Morris-Lecar synaptic model as a template. )
  
</ol> 
<p> 
<a name=hw3.2> <h3> Homework 3.2 </h3> </a>

Fire up the <a href=newstyle.html#pir> post-inhibitory rebound model </a>
that you studied in <a href=xpptut3.html#hw2.4> Homework 2.4. </a> Set
<tt> I=-1 </tt> and set <tt> Dt=.25 </tt>   Find the periodic solution
for this value of current.  (<em> Hint: </em> It has a period of about
140.75.)  Compute the adjoint or response function.  Then compute the
interaction function using
<ul>
<li> <b> Vsyna,sa' </b> as the synaptic reversal potential and the
synaptic gating variable.  This is the fast GABA A synapse.
<li> <b> Vsynb,sb' </b>  This is the slow GABA B synapse.
</ul>
Contrast the stability of synchrony and anti-phase solutions for these
two different inhibitory interactions.  Conclude that it is not just the
"sign" of the coupling but the timing that is important for the
interactions between oscillators.
