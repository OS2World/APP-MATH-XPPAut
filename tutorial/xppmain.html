<ul>
<li> <a name="ics">  <b> (I)nitial conds. </b> </a>  This invokes a short list of options for integrating the  differential equations.  The choices are:
<ul> 
 <li> <b> (G)o </b> which uses the initial data in the IC window and the current
 numerics parameters to solve the equation.  The output is drawn in the
 current selected graphics window and the data are saved for later use.  The
 solution continues until either the user aborts by pressing <b> Esc </b>, the
 integration is complete, or storage runs out.
 <li> <b> (N)ew </b>This prompts you at the command line for each
initial condition. It is similar to clicking on something in the <a
href="xpptut.html#icwindow" > initial condition window. </a>
 Press <b> Enter </b> to accept the value presented.
<li> <b> (L)ast </b> This uses the end result of the most recent integration as the
 starting point of the current integration.
<li> <b> (S)hift </b> This is like Last except that the stating time is shifted to the 
current integration time.  This is irrelevant for autonomous systems but is
 useful for nonautonomous ODEs.
<li> <b> (O)ld </b> This uses the most recent initial data as the current initial 
data.  It is essentially the same as Go.
<li> <b> (R)ange </b>  This lets you integrate multiple times with the results shown
 in the graphics window.  Pressing this option produces a new window with
 several boxes to fill in.  First choose the quantity you want to range
 over.  It can be a parameter or a variable.  The integrator will be called
 and this quantity will be changed at the beginning of each integration.
  Then choose the starting and ending value and the number of steps. The
 option Reset storage only stores the last integration.  If you choose not
 to reset, each integraion is appended to storage.  Most likely, storage
 will be exceeded and the integration will overwrite or stop. The option 
to use last initial conditions will automatically use the final result of
 the previous integration as initial dat for the next integration.  Otherwise,
 the current ICs will be used at each step (except of course for the  variable
 through wich you are ranging.) When you are happy with the parameters, simply
 press the OK button.  Otherwise, press the Cancel button to abort.  Assuming
 that you have accepted, the program will compute the trajectories and plot 
them storing none of them or all of them.  If you press <b> Esc</b> it will abort the 
current trajectory and move on to the next.  Pressing the <b> / </b> key will abort
 the whole process. 
<li> <b> (M)ouse </b>  allows you to specify the values with the mouse.  Click at the
 desired spot.
</ul>
<p>

 <li> <a name="cont">  <b> (C)ontinue.</b></a>  This allows you to continue integrating appending the data
 to the 
current curve. Type in the new ending time.
<p> <li> <a name="ncline"> <b> (N)ullclines </b> </a>  This option allows you to draw the nullclines of systems.  
They are most useful for two-dimensional models, but XPP lets you draw them for
 any model.  The constraints are the same as in the <a href=#dfield>
direction fields </a> option.  The menu has 4 items.
<ul>
<li> <b> (N)ew </b> draws a new set of nullclines.
<li> <b> (R)estore </b> restores the most recently computed set.
<li> <b> (A)uto </b> turns on a flag that makes 
XPP redraw them every time it is necessary because some other window obscured
 them.
<li> <b> (M)anual </b> turns this flag off so that you must restore them manually.
 The X-axis nullcline is blue and the Y-axis nullcline is red.
 </ul>
<p>

<li> <a name="dfield">  <b> (D)irection Field/Flow </b> </a>
This option is best used for two-dimensional systems however,
 it can be applied to any system.  The current graphics view must be a
 two-d plot in which both variables are different and neithet is the time
 variable, T.  There are two items.
<ul>
<li> <b> (D)irection fields </b> Choosing the direcion field option will prompt you for 
a grid size.  The two dimensional plane is broken into a grid of the size
 specified and lines are drwan at each point specifying the direction of 
the flow at that point.  If the system is more than two-dimensional, the
 other variables will be held at the values in the initial conditions
window.
<li> <b>  (F)low </b> Choosing the flow, you will be prompted for a grid size
and
 trajectories
 started at each point on the grid will be integrated according to the
 numerical parameters.  Any given trajectory can be aborted by pressing 
<b> Esc</b> and the whole process stopped by pressing <b> /</b>.  The
remaining
 variables 
if in more than two-dimensions are initialized with the values in the IC window.
</ul>


<li> <a name="wind">  <b>(W)indow</b> </a> allows you to rewindow the current graph.  Pressing this presents 
another menu with the choices:
<ul>
	<li> <b>(W)indow</b>  A window pops up prompting you for the values.  
Press OK or CANCEL when done.
	<li> <b>(Z)oom in</b>  Use the mouse to expand a region by clicking, dragging and 
releasing.  The view in the rectangle will be expanded to the whole window.
	<li> <b>Zoom (O)ut</b>  As above but the whole window will be shrunk into the 
rectangle.
	<li> <b>(F)it</b>  The most common command will automatically fit the window so 
the entire curve is contained within it.  For three-D stuff the window data 
will be scaled to fit into a cube and the cube scaled to fit in the window. 
Use this often.
</ul>
(NOTE:  On some displays, no rubber boxes are drawn for the zooming
operations.  If this occurs, run with the <b> -xorflag </b> option on
the command line. 
<p>

<li> <a name="phase"> <b>ph(A)se space</b> </a>  XPP allows for periodic domains so that you can solve 
equations on a torus or cylinder.  You will be prompted to make (A)ll variables
periodic, (N)o variables periodic or (C)hoose the ones you want.  You will 
be asked for the period which is the same for all periodic variables (if they 
must be different, rescale them) Choose them by name or by clicking the 
appropriate names from the list presented to you. An <b> X </b> will
appear next to the selected ones.  Clicking toggles the <b> X </b>. 
 Type <b> Esc</b> when done or CANCEL or DONE.
 XPP mods your variables by this period and is smart
 enough when plotting to not join the two ends. 
<p>
<li> <a name="kine"> <b>(K)inescope</b> </a> This allows you to capture the bitmap of the active window and
 play it back.  It works poorly in some versions of X, you cannot save the bitmaps, nor will
 it run properly across the network.  This is not my fault, it is idiosyncratic
 with X.  It is slow also.  
<ul>
<li> <b>(C)apture</b> which takes a snapshot of the 
currently active window
<li> <b>(K)ill</b> which deletes all the snapshots
<li> <b>(A)utoplay</b> which 
continuously plays back snapshots until you press the middle mouse
button
<li> <b>(P)layback</b> which cycles thru the pictures each time you click the left mouse 
button and stops if you click the middle.  It will beep when done.
</ul>

<p> 
<li> <a name="graph"> <b>(G)raphic stuff</b> </a> 
This induces a popup menu with several
choices.
<ul>
<li> <b>(A)dd curve</b>  This lets you add another curve to the picture. A 
parameter box will appear asking you for the variables on each axis, a color,
 and line type (only 1 - solid and 0 - dotted are allowed currently) All 
subsequent integrations and restorations will include the new graph.  Up to 
10 per window are allowed.
<li> <b>(D)elete last</b>  Will remove most recent curve.
<li> <b>(A)ll but first</b> Deletes all curves but first.
<li> <b>(E)dit curve</b>  You will be asked for th curve to edit.  The first is 0,
 the second 1, etc.  You will get a parameter box like the add curve
option.
<li> <b>(P)ostscript</b>  This will ask you for a file name and write a 
postscript representation of the current window.  Nullclines, text, 
and all graphs will be plotted.  You can use plot black and white or color. 
 Black and white will try to make each differently colored curve a different
linestyle.
<li> <a href="xppfreeze.html#freeze" > (F)reeze</b> </a>  This will create a permanent curve in the window.  Usualiy, 
when you reintegrate the equations or load in some new data, the current curve 
will be replace by the new data.  Freeze prevents this.  Up to 26 curves can be
 frozen.  

</ul>
<p> 
<li> <a href="xppnum.html#numerics"> n(U)merics </a> This menu controls the
numerical aspects of the program. 
<p>
<li> <a href="xppfile.html#file"> (F)ile </a>  
This brings up a menu with several options.
<p>


<li> <a name="para" > <b>(P)arameters</b> </a>  
  Type the name of a parameter to change or click on its name 
in <a href="xpptut.html#paramwin"> parameter
window. </a>.  Type 
<b> default </b> to get back the values when you started XPP.  
<p>
<li> <a name="erase">  <b>(E)rase</b> </a>
 erases the contents of the active window, redraws the
axes, 
deletes all 
text in the window, and sets the redraw flag to Manual.
<p>
<li> <a name="half"> <b>(H)alfwindow</b> </a> This name is a holdover from the DOS version.  The option allows
 you to create and destroy graphics windows. There are several
choices.
<ul>  
<li> <b>(C)reate</b> makes a copy of the currently active window and makes itself active.
  You can change the graphs in this window without affecting the other windows. 

<li> <b>(K)ill all</b>  Removes all but the main graphics window.

<li> <b>(D)estroy</b>  This destroys the currently active window.  The main window
 cannot be destroyed.  

<li> <b>(A)uto</b> turns on a flag so that the window will automatically be
redrawn when needed.

<li> <b>(M)anual</b> turns off the flag and the user must restore the picture manually.

<li> <b>(B)ottom</b> puts the active window on the bottom.
</ul>
<p>
<li> <a name="text">  <b>(T)ext etc</b> </a> allows you to write text to the display in a variety of sizes and in two different fonts.  You can
also add other symbols to your graph. 
<ul>
<li> <b>Text</b> This prompts you for the text you want to add.  Then you
are asked for the size; there are five choices (0-5): 0-8pt, 1-12pt, 2-14pt,
3-18pt, 4-24pt. Next you are asked for the font: 0-TimesRoman,
1-Symbol. Note that not all X-servers will have these fonts, but the
postscript file will still draw them. Finally, place the text with the
mouse.
<li><b>Arrow</b> This lets you draw an arrow-head to incicate a direction
on a trajectory.  You will be prompted for the size, which should be
some positive number, usually less than 1.  Then you must move the the
mouse and select a direction and starting point.  Click on the
starting point and holding the mouse buttton down, drag the mouse to
indicate the direction of the arrow-head. Then release the
mouse-button and the arrow will be drawn.  
<li><b>Pointer</b> This is like an arrow, but draws the stem as well as
the arrow head.  It can be used to point to important features of your
graph. The prompts are like those for <tt> Arrow.</tt>
<li><b>Edit</b> This lets you edit the text,arrows, and pointers in one of
three ways:
<ul>
<li><b>Move</b> lets you move the object to another location without
changing any of its properties.  Choose the object with the mouse by
clicking near it.
You will then be prompted as to whether you want to move the item that
XPP selected.  If you answer <tt> yes </tt> use the mouse to reposition it.
<li><b>Change</b> lets you change the properties: for text, the text
itself, size, and font can be change; for arrows and pointers, only
the size of the arrow head can be changed. As above, select the object
with the mouse and then edit the properties.
<li><b>Delete</b> deletes the object that you select with the mouse.
</ul>
<li><b>Delete All</b> Deletes all the objects in the current window.
</ul>

<li> <a name="sing">  <b>(S)ing pts</b> </a>
  This allows you to calculate equilibria for a system. There
 are three options.
<ul> 
	<li> <b>(G)o</b> begins the calculation   using the values in the initial 
data box as a first guess.  Newton's method is applied.  If a value is found XPP
 tries to find the eigenvalues and asks you if you want them printed out.  If so,
 they are written to the console.  Then if there is a single real positive or
 real negative eigenvalue, the program asks you if you want the unstable or
 stable manifolds to be plotted.  Answer yes if so and they will be
 approximated. The calculation will continue until either a variable
goes out
 of bounds or you press (Esc).  If (Esc) is pressed, the other
branch is
 computed. 
 The program continues to find any other invariant sets until it has gotten 
them all.  (These are stored and can be accessed by clicking <a
href=xppmain.html#ics> (I) </a> (H).)  The program will continue integrating
beyond the current numerical parameters until you press (Esc).
Once an 
equilibrium is computed a window 
appears with info on the value of the point and its stability.  The top of 
the window tells you the number of complex eigenvalues with
positive,<b> (c+) </b>, 
negative <b> (c-)</b>, zero <b> (im) </b>  real parts and the number of
real positive
<b>  (r+) </b>  and 
real negative <b> (r-)</b>  eigenvalues. I
f the equation is a difference equation, 
then the symbols correspond the numbers of real or complex eigenvalues 
outside <b> (+) </b> the unit circle or inside <b> (-) </b>
This window remains and can be iconified. 
<li> <b>(M)ouse</b>  This is as above but you can specify the initial guess by 
clicking the mouse.  Only the two variables in the two-D window will reflect 
the mouse values.  This is most useful for 2D systems.
<li> <b>(R)ange</b>  This allows you to find a set of equilibria over a range
 of parameters.  A parameter box will prompt you for the parameter, starting
 and ending values, number of steps.  Additionally, two other items are 
requested.  Column for stability will record the stability of the equilibrium 
point in the specified column.  If you elect to shoot at each, the invariant 
manifolds will be drawn for each equilibrium computed.  The stability can be 
read as a decimal number of the form <b>  u.s  </b> where <b> s </b>  is the
number of stable and <b> u </b>  
 the number of unstable eigenvalues. So 2.03 means 3 eigenvalues
with negative real parts (or in the unit circle) and 2 with positive
real parts (outside the unit circle.)  The result of a range calculation is saved 
in the data array and replaces what ever was there.  The value of the parameter
 is in the time column, the equilibria in the remaining columns and the 
stability info in whatever column you have specified. 
 (Esc) aborts one step and 
(/)  aborts the whole procedure.
</ul> 
<li> <a name="view">  <b>(V)iew axes</b> </a>
 This selects one of 2 different types of graphs: 
a 2D box or a 3D Box.
If you select the 2D curve, you will be asked for limits 
as in the window command as well as the variables to place on the axes
and the labels for the axes.   
3D is more complicated.  You will be asked for the 3 variables for the 3 axes, 
their max and min values and 4 more numbers, <b> XLO </b> ,  etc.  XPP first scales the 
data to fit into a cube with corners (-1,-1,-1) and (1,1,1).  Rotation of this
 cube is performed and then projected into the two-D window.  <b> XLO
</b>
, etc define
 the scales of this projection and are thus unrelated to the values of your 
data.  You are also asked for labels of the axes.
Use the <a href="#wind"> (W) </a> (F)  option 
to automatically choose the sizes for the graph.


<li> <a name="xivst" >  <b>(X)i vs t</b> </a>  This chooses a certain 2D view and prompts you for the variable name. 
 The window is automatically fitted and the data plotted.  It is a
shortcut to choosing a view and windowing it.
<li> <a name="restore">  <b>(R)estore</b> </a> 
 redraws the most recent data in the browser in accordance with the
 graphics parameters ofthe active window.
<li> <a name="3d"> <b>(3)d params</b> </a>
  This lets you choose rotations of the axes and
persepctive  planes. 
 Play with this to see. You must be have a 3D view in the active graph
to use this.
<li> <a name="bdry"> <b>(B)ndry val</b> </a>  This solves boundary value problems by numerical shooting. There
 are 4 choices.
<ul> 
<li> <b>(S)how</b>  This shows the successive results of the shooting and 
erases the screen at the end and redraws the last solution.  The program
 uses the currently selected numerical integation method, the current starting
 point, <b> T0 </b> as the left end time and  <b> T0+TEND </b> as the right
end. These are set in the <a href="xppnum.html"> nUmerics </a> menu.
 Thus, if the
 interval of interest is  (2.5,6)then set <b> T0=2.5 </b> and <b>
TEND=3.5 </b> in the numerics menu.  
<li> <b>(N)o show</b> This is as above but will not show succesive solutions.
<li> <b>(R)ange</b>  This allows you to range over a parameter keeping starting or
 ending values of each of the variables.  A window will appear asking you for
 the parameter, the start, end, and steps.  You will also be asked if you want 
to cycle color which means that the results of each successful solution to the
 BVP will appear in different colors. Finally the box labeled<b>  side
</b>
 tells the
 program whether to save the initial <b> (0) </b> or final<b> (1) </b>
values of 
the solution. 
 As the program progresses, you will see the current parameter in the info
 window under the main screen.  You can abort the current step by
pressing
(Esc)
and the whole process by pressing (/). 
<li> <b>(P)eriodic</b> Periodic boundary conditions can be solved thru the
usual methods, but one then must write an addition equation for the
frequency parameter.  This option eliminates that need so that a 2-D
autonomous system need not be suspended into a 3D one.  You will be
asked for the name of the adjustable parameter for frequency.  You
will also be asked for the section variable and section.  This is an additional
condition that must be satisfied, namely, <i>x(0)=x_0 </i> where <i>x</i>is the
section variable and <i> x_0 </i> is the section.  Type <b> yes </b>if you want
the progress shown.
