<h1> <a name="start"> IV. Two dimensional systems </a> </h1>

<p> So far, we have looked at a scalar equation for a membrane with a
single nonlinear channel.  We hinted <a href=xpptut2.html#oscil> above
</a> that by letting the current vary slowly as a function of the
current, we could induce oscillations in the membrane.  Real membranes
do this but not by directly varing the current.  Rather, in addition
to the fast inward calcium current, there is an additional voltage
controlled outward current due to potassium.  That is, the potassium
current turns on with high enough voltage and hyperpolarizes the
membrane.  The equations for this model; the <a name=lecar>
"Morris-Lecar" </a>  model are:
<p>
<a href=odes/mor_lec.ode>

where
<p>
<center> <img src=gif/winf.gif> </center><p>

We will also track the main currents, <i> ICa </i> and <i> IK. </i>
Click <a href=newstyle.html#mlsrc> <b> HERE </b> </a> to see the source.


<p>

Let's set up the window so we can explore this system.  Time is
measured in milliseconds so click (nUmerics) to get the <a
href=xppnum.html> numerics </a> menu.  Change (Dt) to .25 and change
(Total) to 100 msec.  Since the currents can get quite large, change
(Bounds) from 100 to 1000. Click (Esc)  to return to the main window.
Click on (W) (W)  to change the dimensions of the <a
href=xppmain.html#wind> window:</a>
<ul>
<li> XLo: 0
<li> XHi: 100
<li> YLo: -80
<li> YHi: 120
</ul>
Then click (Ok) or the type (Tab).  Type (I) (G) and a line will move
straight across the screen.  The system has initially been set at
rest.  Now try some different initial conditions: Click (I) (N) and
start at, say, V=-20, keeping w the default value.
  The voltage decays to rest.  Now try V(0)=-10. There is a big
difference.  The voltage rises and then decays below rest before
returning to rest.  This is called <b> excitability </b> and it is a
typical phenomenon of neurons.  
<p>
<a name=plot>  <h3> More Plotting Tricks </h3> </a>
<p>
To understand this, it helps to look at the two currents.  Click on
(H) (C) to <a href=xppmain.html#half> create </a> another window.  Click
(X) and type in <b> ICa </b> followed by (Enter) and you will see the
large negative calcium current plotted in the window.  Now in the
mainwindow, click (G) (A) to <a href=xppmain.html#graph> add </a>
another curve to the plot. A new window will appear.  Type <b> IK </b>
where it asks for the <b> Y-axis </b> and type in a number from 1-9
for the color (1=red, 9=violet) and then type (Ok) to accept it.
  (<b> Note: </b> This is different than <a href=xppfreeze.html>
freezing </a> a curve which keeps a <b> permanent </b> copy of the
curve you have frozen.  <b> Adding </b> a curve just tells XPP to plot
the variables you have added at every simulation. <i> If you change
parameters or initial conditions, the added curves will change to
reflect this.  Frozen curves do not change.</i>)
<p>
You will not see the new curve since XPP has not given you the best
window. You can manually increase the window, or let XPP do it.  Click
(W) (F) to fit the window. (NOTE: This only works in versions of XPP
higher than 1.6.) Otherwise just use (W) (W) and make the vertical
scales from -380 to 270.  
<p>
Click (T) for <a href=xppmain.html#text> text </a> and at the prompt
type in "ICa" and (Enter).  Using the mouse, place the text next to
the big negative calcium current and click it.  Repeat this for "IK."
If you have done this, you will see something like:
<p>
<center>
<img src=gif/mlcurrents.gif> </center> <p>
Now we can see what <i> excitability </i> means.  Once the voltage
crosses threshold there is a large inward calcium current.  After this
reaches its peak causing the voltage to increase, the large outward
potassium current comes into play.  This is sufficient to cause the
membrane to repolarize back to rest.
<p>
<a name=hw2.1> <h3> Homework 2.1 </h3> </a>
What is the most negative value of the calcium current and the most
positive of the potassium. (Use the <a href=xppbrowse.html> Data
Viewer
</a>  (F)ind option.)
Integrate the differential equations again with a subthreshold initial
voltage, say V(0)=-20.  How are the currents different from the
spiking case.  (You may have to click into the small window and then
click on (R)estore to redraw the graphs.)  
<p>
<center>
<img src=gif/rainbowline.gif> </center> <p>
<h2> <a name=phase> Periodics and phase-plane analysis </a> </h2><p>
Click inside the big graphics window showing the voltage. Click on (H)
(K) to kill all extra windows and answer (Yes).  This will get rid of
the little window.  Now click on (U) to go into the (nUmerics) window
and change the (Total) time to 250 msec and hit (Esc) to return to the
main window.  Click (V) (2) to get a <a href=xppmain.html#view> Two-d
view </a> of the voltage and the potassium gating variable, <i> w
</i>.  A new window will appear.  You must tell XPP the variables for
the X and Y axes, the (optional) labels and dimensions of the window
(although this can be done with the (Window) command.) We want the
"X-axis" to have voltage and the "Y-axis" to have the gating
variable. Fill it in as:
<ul>
<li> X-axis: V 
<li> Y-axis: w
<li> XMin: -80
<li> YMin: -.25
<li> XMax: 120
<li> YMax: 1.25
<li> XLabel: V
<li> YLabel: w
</ul>
and then click (Ok) or type (Tab) to accept this.  <p>
This is called a <b> phase-plane </b> picture and it is what the "PP"
in XPP stands for.  The <b> phase-space </b> for the Morris-Lecar
model is two-dimensional and this provides a nice compact way of
seeing what the solutions do as a function of time. 
Click (I) (N) and set V(0)=-20 and leave w as is. Note the small
trajectory thet goes to the left.  Now initialize V(0)=-10 and see the
difference. The trajectory loops through the two-dimensional plane
before returning to rest. Note that the phase-plane view shows you
that the voltage increases and the gating variable slowly increases.
The voltage reaches a maximum but the gating variable continues to
increase reaching a maximum and then decreasing. The voltage
udershoots the equilibrium before returning to rest.
<p>
Now click on (S) (M) to use the mouse to
make an initial guess for a <a href=xppmain.html#sing> singular </a>
point or equilibrium.  Click the mouse near where the two trajectories
have ended.  Answer (No) to the "Print Eigenvalues" question.  A small
circle will appear in the phase-plane that shows the position of the
equilibrium.  The <a href=xpptut.html#stabwind> stability window </a>
tells you you have a rest state at V=-60.89 and w=.014, that it is
stable, and that the two eigenvalues are complex.  
<p>
Click on (I) (M) to choose initial conditions in the phase-plane with
the mouse.  Click anywhere in the plane and the trajectory will be
plotted. In particular, try a bunch of initial conditions near w=0
along the V-axis.   Turn off the Bell by clicking (F) (B). Now click
(I) (L) to get a trajectory that starts close to the initial
condition.  ((I) (L) means use the (Last) value of the previous
trajectory as the starting point of this one.)  Now click (I) (R) to
do a range integration. A new window will appear.
 Choose V to be the variable to range over.
Choose 10 Steps, with the start at -20 and the end -10.  Answer yes to
all three questions and click (Ok).  You will see 10 colored
trajectories with a clear point indicating threshold.  You should see
something like this:<p>
<center>
<img src=gif/thresh.gif> </center> <p>

(<i> If this is nothing like what you see, try going through the
instructions again starting at <a href=#phase> the beginning. </a> </i>)
<p>
<center> <img src=gif/rainbowline.gif> </center> <p>
<center> <h3> <a name=nullclines> Nullclines and direction fields </a>
</h3> </center> <p> 
To see what is causing the threshold behavior for the neuron, it is
very helpful to look at the <a href=xppmain.html#ncline> <b>
nullclines </b> </a> which are curves where
<i> dV/dt=0 </i> and <i> dw/dt=0.</i>  The intersection of two
nullclins is an equilibrium point.  Click (N)(N) to make new
nullclines.  The "V" nullcline where V does not change is RED and the
"w" nullcline, where w does not change is green.  They intersect in one
point, the equilibrium.  Their meaning can be discerned from the
figure below:
<p>
<center>
<img src=gif/nullcline1.gif> </center> <p>
The nullclines are labeled and divide the phase-plane into 4 regions
according to whether the voltage V and gating variable, w, 
are increasing or decreasing.  THis lets you qualitatively see what
happens.  Use the (I) (M) command to start with initial conditions in
each of the 4 regions of the phase-plane.  Click on (E) to <a
href=xppmain.html#erase> erase </a>  the
screen and then on <a href=xppmain.html#ncline> (N) (R) </a>
 to restore the nullclines without having to
recompute them.  Now use the mouse to choose initial conditions along
the line <i> w=0 </i> (the x-axis) near the point where the
V-nullcline intersects the x-axis.  Try some intial data to the left
and to the right of the curve.  <i> The nullcline acts almost like a
threshold. </i> 
<p>
 
Now set I=120 by typing (P) and then I and then the value for it.  Hit
(Enter) twice.  If you have the <a href=xpptut.html#paramwin>
parameter window </a> open then just click on I in the window and tyoe
the new value in the <a href=xpptut.html#xppmain> command line. </a>
Once again use the mouse to set the initial data. Click (I) (M) and
then click the mouse in the plane.  You should see a
closed circle in the phase plane, a <b> limit cycle </b> for which
both variables are periodic.  Open another window and plot V as a
function of t.  Click (Halfwindow) (Create).  Then click (Xivst) and
type in V followed by (Enter).  You should se a nice oscillation of
the membrane potential.  Click on (Xivst) and type in <i> w </i> and
see that it oscillates as well.  
<p>
<h3> <a name=3d> Three-d windows and the Kinescope </h3></a>
Create another window.  Click on (View axes) (3d) and a big window
will appear.  Put V,w, and t on the respective X,Y, and Z axes.  Put
the same on the labels.  Click (Ok) and then type (Window) (Fit) to
fit the window to the variables.  You should see a real nice 3d window
with time along the Z axis and  V,w on the planar axes.  <b> Now the next
step sometimes causes crashes on different servers, so you may want to
skip it. </b>  We are going to make a short 4 frame movie.  Click on
<a href=xppmain.html#kine> (Kinescope) (Capture)</a>.  
This will grab the 3D image.  Next, click on <a href=xppmain.html#3d> 
(3d params) </a>.  A window will pop up.  Change <b> Theta </b> from
45 to 60 and click (Ok).   Then take another snapshot with (K)
(C). Again change the 3d angle <b> Theta </b> to 75 and take another
snapshot with (K) (C).  Finally, do this once more with <b> Theta=90
</b> and take the last snapshot.  Now click on (Kinescope) (Autoplay)
and you should see a little rotating "movie" of the 3-d
projection. Type (Esc) to stop it.  Finally clear all the Kinescope
frames with (Kinescope) (Reset).   
<p>

<h3> <a name=hw2.2> Homework 2.2 </h3> </a>
<ul>
<li> Look at ICa and IK in a two-dimensional phase-space. 
<li> Look at the
nullclines in the <b> V-w </b> plane when <b> I=120 </b>
and note that they intersect on
the part of the <b> V-nullcline </b> with a positive slope.  Find the
stability of the singular point where the nullclines intersect. What
is the nature of the eigenvalues?
Change <b> I=80 </b> and look at the nullclines and singular point
again. How has the rest state changed? What behavior occurs for values
of the parameter at which the rest state is <em> unstable? </em>
<li> Try to find the value of <b> I </b> at which the singular point
goes from stable to unstable.  ( <i> Hint: </i>Once you have found an
equilibrium point using the (S) (M) option, try using <a
href=xppmain.html#sing> (S) (G) </a> after
you change <b> I </b> slightly. )
</ul>
<p>

<h2> <a name=hopf> The Hopf bifurcation theorem -- AUTO III</a> </h2>

If you have complete <a href=#hw2.2> Homework 2.2 </a> then you have
discovered that the rest state can lose stability by a pair of <em>
complex-conjugate </em> eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis. You
should have also discovered that there is a periodic solution when the
rest state is unstable.  The existence of a periodic orbit is a
consequence of one of the most <em> useful </em> results in dynamical
systems theory: <b> the Hopf Bifurcation Theorem. </b>  This powerful
theorem says roughly that <em> if a pair of complex conjugate
eigenvalues  crosses the imaginary axis as some parameter changes, then
there is a branch or periodic orbits emanating from rest. </em> <p>
We will use AUTO to find that branch of periodics as well as discover
some other interesting behavior.   Set <b> I=0 </b> and initialize <b>
V=-60.899, w=.01487.</b>  Now click (F) (A) to invoke AUTO.  Now, setr
up the axes by clicking on (Axes), choosing (Hi-Lo) and filling in the
window as:
<ul>
<li> Y-axis: V
<li> Main Parm: i
<li> 2nd Parm: vl
<li> Xmin: -10
<li> Ymin: -80
<li> Xmax: 250
<li> Ymax: 120
</ul>
Click (Ok) and then click on the (Numerics) menu to set AUTO up.
Change the following:
<ul>
<li> Ds: 0.02
<li> Dsmin: 0.0001
<li> Dsmax: 5
<li> Par Min: -10
<li> Par Max: 245
<li> Norm Max: 1000
</ul>
<p>
We are almost ready to roll!!. AUTO and XPP let us record aspects of
the bifurcation curves at chosen values of parameters and periods of
limit cycles.  We want to get information at  <b> I=100 </b> and,
say, <b> I=120.</b>
This is done by clicking on (Usr Period). Do this and
choose 2.  A window pops up.  Fill in the first two entries like:
<ul>
<li> Uzr1: i=100
<li> Uzr2: i=120
</ul>
and click (Ok).  <p>
Now we can run!  Click on (Run) and choose (Steady state).  A thick
line which is thin in the middle is drawn across the screen.  The
thick parts are where the steady state is stable, the thin, unstable.
<p> How does the steady state lose stability?  Click on (Grab) and
move the cross-hairs until they are close to the instability.  Look at
the information line as you do this. You should see a symbol <b> HB
</b> at around <b> I=101.8 </b>   How does this compare with your
estimate of the value of current which leads to instability 
in the homework? The symbol <b> HB </b> means that there is a <b> Hopf
bifurcation </b> so we can expect to see a branch of solutions
emanating from the rest state.  When the cross-hair is on the <b> HB
</b> point, click
(Enter) to accept it.  When you accept a point in AUTO, this sets the
parameters and dependent variables to the initial condition
corresponding to the point.  It also gives AUTO some necessary
information.  <p>

Now that we have grabbed the Hopf point, we can try to find the
periodic orbit.  <em> Note:  The next command may induce AUTO to
loop around so once it looks like AUTO is retracing stuff it already
found, click on (ABORT). </em>  So forewarned, click on (Run).  Choose
(Periodic) to get AUTO to trace the orbit.  Stop it if it looks like
its retracing!  When the diagram is complete it will look like:
<p>
<center><img src=gif/autohopf.gif> </center> <p>

Filled circles represent stable periodic orbits and open circles are
unstable.  Notice how the unstable branch that emanates from the Hopf
bifurcation bends to the left and thet the steady state solution loses
stability to the right.  If the direction of the bifurcating branch is
opposite the direction at which stability of the main branch is lost,
the branch is called <b> subcritical </b> and it is generally <b>
unstable. </b>  Note that there are two subcritical Hopf bifurcations;
the second one is for a high current of about 220.  (It is subcritical
because the steady state branch loses the stability going <em> left
</em> and the periodic branch goes <em> right. </em>) <p>
Click (Grab). Using the (Tab) key, slowly click through the <a
href=xppauto.html#special> special points. </a> Note the labels <tt>
UZ </tt> and <tt> LP </tt>.  The label <tt> UZ </tt> is a user-defined
point and since we picked <b>I=100 </b> and <b> I=120 </b>, it means
that <b> I </b> must be one of these two values.  The label <tt> LP
</tt> means that a limit-point or saddle node has been found.  Since
it occurs on a branch of periodic solutions, that means that two limit
cycle orbits coalesce at this point.  For this
particular model, the left most limit point occurs at <b> I =
95.72. </b>
<p>  

In many biological examples, subcritical branches from Hopf
bifurcations <em> turn around. </em> The Morris-Lecar model, here, is
such an example.  
Focus your attention on the region between the Hopf bifurcation  and
the left-most limit point, <b> 95.72 &lt I &lt 101.8 </b>  For
currents in this interval, there are 3 different possible
solutions. (Imagine a vertical line drawn in this interval; it passes
through three branches.) There is a <em> stable steady state, unstable
periodic, stable periodic. </em>  
<ol>
<li> Using (Grab) load the second point on
the bifurcation diagram for which <b> I=100 </b> (label 8). 
<li> Now click (File) (Import Orbit). Special points have more
information than regular points.  Grabbing any point changes the
parameter and initial conditions in XPP. But you can actually load the
complete trajectory of a periodic orbit if it is a special one.  
<li> In the XPP main window, you should have a phase-plane projection
of V and w.  If not, then <a href=xppmain.html#view> do so now </a>
with  <em> -80 &lt V &lt 120 </em> and <em> -.25 &lt w &lt 1.25. </em>
Click on (Restore) in the XPP main window.  (Since the nullclines are
probably wrong, erase the screen by clicking on (Erase) then draw new
nullclines for this value of I by clicking (N) (N), then click (R) to
restore.) You should see a very small periodic orbit surrounding the
fixed point marked by the intersection of the nullclines.  Check the
stability of the rest state by clicking (S) (M) in the XPP window and
clicking the mouse at the intersection -- answer (No) to the
eigenvalue question.  It is stable.
<li> Lets get a permanent copy of the small orbit.  Click (G) (F) (F)
to <a href=xppfreeze.html> freeze </a> the small orbit. Choose color 4
and make the key have the label "UPO."   
<li> Go back to the AUTO window and click grab again.  This time load
the third instance for which the current is 100.  This is labeled
point 10.  Again, click (F) (I) in the AUTO window to import this
orbit.   
<li> Go back to the main XPP window and freeze this using (G) (F) (F)
and choosing color 7 and labeling the key, "SPO". You should see two
periodics in the picture, one stable and one unstable.
<li>  Finally, choose a variety of initial conditions by clicking (I)
(M) in the XPP window and clicking the mouse inside the small
periodic, between the two periodics, and outside the large periodic.
(It might be easier to see if you <a href=xppmain.html#wind> zoom </a>
in so that the picture contains the two periodics.  Click (W) (Z) and
use the mouse key to zoom in. )  
</ol>

<p>  If you have followed these instructions, then you will have
discoverd another type of <b> bistability </b> between a stable fixed
point and a stable periodic orbit.  All initial conditions <em> inside
</em> the unstable periodic orbit end up at the stable fixed point.
All initial data <em> outside </em> the unstable periodic end up on the stable
periodic state.  The unstable periodic orbit is a threshold for
repetitive firing.  Create another window and plot V as a function of
t for some represetative trajectories.

<h3> <a name=freq> Frequency information </a> </h3>

Go into the AUTO window and click (Axes) (fRequency) to look at the
frequency of the periodics as a function of the current. Click (Ok) in
the window that appears.  Now click (Axes) (Fit) and then (reDraw) to
fit the window to the frequency and redraw the diagram.  Only the
periodics appear on this.  Focus on the solid circles.  The frequency
initially goes up and then goes down.  Note that the minimal frequency
is not zero.  (Also, note that this is frequency in the time scale of
the model which is milliseconds.  Multiply by 1000 to get it in
Hertz.) Click (Axes) (last 1 par) and then (reDraw) to get the
original diagram back.  

<p> This concludes the tutorial on periodic, bistability, and AUTO.
You can play around some more with this diagram (for example, pick
some currents at the high end where there is also bistability.) 
When you are done, reset the bifurcation diagram to delete unwanted
files from the disk: In the AUTO window, reset the diagram by clicking
(File) (Reset) and answering (Yes).  Exit XPP or try the next homework
which is quite extensive.

<p><center><img src=gif/rainbowline.gif> </center> <p>
<h3> <a name=hw2.3> Homework 2.3 </h3> </a>

In this exercise, you will explore the Morris-Lecar model as it was
originally formulated.  Fire up the <a href=#lecar> Morris-Lecar </a>
equations if you don't all ready have them loaded.  Change the 
<a href=xppmain.html#para> parameters </a> from the loaded values to :
<ul>
<li> V3=12
<li> V4=17.4
<li> I=0
<li> phi=.066666667
</ul>
Set up the numerics so that<ul>
<li> Dt=.25
<li> Bound=1000
<li> Total=250
</ul> 
and a two-dimensional view with -80 &lt V &lt 120 on the x-axis and
-.25 &lt w &lt 1.25 on the y-axis.  <p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the nullclines for I=0, I=30, I=50.  Look at trajectories and
determine the stability of all fixed points.  At what value of I does
repetitive firing occur?  For I=30, what determines the threshold?
Try the following with I=30.  Draw the nullclines.  Click on (S) (M)
to use the mouse to find singular points and choose the middle
intersection of the nullclines.  Answer (No) to the eigenvalue
question and (Yes) to the invariant sets. Watch the trajectories that
appear. (Click Esc to make it draw the next one, -- it will try to
draw 4 of them)  Note the pair that come out almost vertically.  Click
some initial conditions on either side of them and note the behavior.
They determine the threshold. 
<li> Now, set I=0 and initialize V to -59.474 and w to 0.  Fire up the
AUTO window if it is not already there (F) (A).  If it is there,make
sure the diagram has been reset (Click (File) (Reset Diagram)).  Now
set up the axes and numerics just like the example <a
href=#hopf>above. </a> Run AUTO starting from a steady state. How is
the steady state I-V curve different from the first example? Notice
that even though it is "kinked" there are never two stable rest states
for the same parameters.
<li>  How does the upper steady state gain/lose stability?  Use (Grab)
to find out if there is a Hopf bifurcation.  Grab it and trace out the
curve of periodics.  Compare this scenario with the above one.  Look
at the frequency as a function of I.  Concentrate on the stable
branch.  What is the minimal frequency?  
<li>  In this scenario, the periodic orbit emerges with large
amplitude and zero frequency.  It is called Type I behavior.  The
limit cycle disappears exactly at the value of current for which the
two lower steady states come together.  
</ol>

Finally, set phi=.25 and repeat the entire exercise above.  Note how
the periodic is lost this time.  It runs into the middle branch. Set
I=31 and explore the phaseplane.  In particular, look at the stability
and invariant sets of the middle branch.       
<p><center><img src=gif/rainbowline.gif> </center> <p>
<h3> <a name=hw2.4> Homework 2.4 </h3> </a>
Wang and Rinzel have suggested a simple two-dimensional model for
reticular oscillations in the thalamus. This <a
href=newstyle.html#pir> post-inhibitory rebound model </a> has
oscillations if the current is negative. There are also equations for
two different types of inhibitory synapses, thus it is a
five-dimensional model, but all the dynamics is in the <i> V-h </i>
variables.
 Explore the phase-plane and
compute the bifurcation diagram for this using AUTO and the current as
a parameter.  Try, <b> -2 &lt I &lt 0 </b> as the range for the
current. (<b> AUTO Hint </b>  When <b> I=0 </b> the equilibrium is 
<tt> V=-59.401, h=.019457,sa=.00152,tb=.041924,sb=.20099 </tt>)
<b> CAUTION </b>  AUTO seems to crash when you follow the right-most
Hopf bifurcation point too far to the left, so stop the continuation
before the "knee" in the steady states.
