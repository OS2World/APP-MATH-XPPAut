<h1> <a name="nonlin1"> II. Nonlinear ODES </a> </h1>

<p>

If all differential equations were linear, then life would be easier
but not so interesting.  Most of the models that arise in real
physical systems involve nonlinearities and as a consequence a much
broader range of behavior is possible such as <a href=#chaos> chaos
</a> and <a href=#periodic> oscillations </a>.  We will continue
building our simple membrane model by adding a <a name=exam2_int> nonlinear
</a> voltage-dependent conductance.  This conductance is due to calcium.
The <a name=mlc> equation </a> is
<p>
<a href=odes/mlcal.ode>
<img align=center src=gif/mlcal.gif> </a> <p>

where 
<p>
<img align=center src=gif/minf.gif> <p>

This equation is already too difficult to solve analytically so one
sees the advantage of numerical and qualitative techniques. (Actually,
you can write the solution down in terms of an integral which you
cannot evaluate except numerically!)  <p>
The ODE file for this equation in the old style is 
<pre>
<a name=mlcal>
# One fast persistent calcium channel
# Here is the equation
dv/dt=(i+gl*(vl-v)+gca*minf(v)*(vca-v))/c

#and the initial condition
V(0)=-60

# and the calcium current
aux ica=gca*minf(v)*(v-vca)

# and the parameters
param vl=-60,vca=120
param i=0,gl=2,gca=4,c=20
param v1=-1.2,v2=18

# and the functions
minf(v)=.5*(1+tanh((v-v1)/v2))
done

</pre>

I have attempted to make comments which tell you what is going on.
There are 2 new things here.  <b> Auxiliary </b> quantities and <b>
User defined </b> functions.  Since functions are really important we will
cover them first.<p>
<h2> <a name=user> User defined functions.</h2> </a> <p>   
User defined functions are declared just like you would write them.  They can have up to 9 arguments. 
 Thus  the function <b> minf </b> has <b> 1 </b>
argument and is a squashing function.  A function of 2 variables, say,
<i> f(x,y)=exp(x)*sin(y) </i> would be written as
<pre>
f(x,y)=exp(x)*sin(y)
</pre>
 
<p>
<a name=auxiliary> <h2> Auxiliary quantities. </h2></a>  <p>  
 We saw in the previous example that it was possible to add new <a
href=xppbrowse.html#addcol> columns </a> 
to the <a href=xppbrowse.html> Data Browser </a> window.  This is fine
if you think of something you want to compute while in XPP.  But the
<b> auxiliary </b> declaration allows you to incorporate quantities
that are not explicitly solutions to differential equations but
instead some combinations of them.  They are declared by starting the
line with <b> aux </b> followed by the name of the quantity an equal
sign and the definition. Now when you run this, you will be able to
save the value of the calcium current and plot it as a function of time.
<p>
<h3> <a name=hw1.3> Homework 1.3 </h3>
Add another auxiliary variable to your file which tracks the leak
current,  <i> gl*(V-VL) </i>.  
<p>

<h2> <a name=fixed> Fixed quantities </a> </h2> <p>
In the above examples, the calcium current is computed twice: once in
the definition of the right-hand side and another time as an auxiliary
quantity.  While for this simple example, it probably doesn't matter
(unless you are running on a PC with no math coprocessor) there are
plenty of times when it will.  If you were writing a program in C or
FORTRAN you might define an intermediate quantity and use it to save
on computation time.  In XPP, this is done with <b> fixed </b>
quantities that are declared by typing <b> name=formula </b> into the
file. Fixed quantities are always evaluated before the right-hand
sides are evaluated and are evaluated in the order that they are
defined.
<p>
Thus, a faster version of the ode is 
<a href=odes/mlcalf.ode> 
<pre>
# One fast persistent calcium model with fixed quantities </a>
# Here is the equation
dv/dt=(i+gl*(vl-v)-icaf)/c

#and the initial condition
V(0)=-60

# and the calcium current as a fixed quantity
icaf=gca*minf(v)*(v-vca)

# make ica available to look at
aux ica=icaf

# and the parameters
param vl=-60,vca=120
param i=0,gl=2,gca=4,c=20
param v1=-1.2,v2=18

# and the functions
minf(v)=.5*(1+tanh((v-v1)/v2))
done
</pre> 
<i> NOTE </i> XPP complains if things have the same names, thus, I
have not named the AUXILIARY and the FIXED variables the same thing.

<p>  
You have now learned the essential components of an ODE file: 
<ul> 
<li> Declaration of differential equations
<li> Declaration of parameters
<li> Fixed variables
<li> Auxiliary quantities
<li> User defined functions
<li> Initial conditions
</ul>
Most applications use no more than this.

<h3> <a name=hw1.4> Homework 1.4</h3>
<p>
 Consider the nonlinear pendulum <p>

style. Keep track of the energy with an auxiliary variable.

<h2> <a name=hysteresis> Multiple equilibria and hysteresis </a> </h2> 
    

<p>
 Now that you undestand the essentials of creating an ODE file, we
will explore some more of the features of the program.  Recall that we
wish to explore:


<p>
<a href=odes/mlcal.ode>
<img align=center src=gif/mlcal.gif> </a> <p>

where 
<p>
<img align=center src=gif/minf.gif> <p>

Fire the file up by clicking on the equation.  As usual the main
window and  the others will show up on the screen.  Let's take a look
at a very important set of menus:
<p>
<h2> <a name=numerics>  Numerics Menu </a></h2>
<p>
Click (U) or on the <a href=xppnum.html><b> n(U)merics </b> </a>
part of the main menu (<i>
i.e. </i> type "U") and a  new menu  will appear.
<p>
<img align=center src=gif/numcom.gif> <p>
This menu is very important as it sets the parameters for all of the
numerical algorithms in XPP. Details of the commands for this are
found by clicking on the title of this section.  I will briefly
summarize the other most important commands for you.  For the present
example, the voltage can reach up to 120 mV.  XPP attempts to prevent
numerical overflow by stopping a calculation when any variable or
auxiliary quantity exceeds a <b> Bound </b> that is set by the user.
The default when XPP fires up is <b> 100 </b> which is less than what
we would like.  Set the <b> Bound </b> to 1000 by clicking on (B) and
adding a 0 to make the global bount 1000 instead of 100. Type (Enter)
when you are done.  Next, we want to integrate for at least 200 msec
so change the amount of time to integrate to 200.  Do this by clicking
on (T) for <b> Total </b> and changing the 20 to 200 and typing
(Enter).   <p>
Now is a good time to take a look at other things in this menu.  The
time step for integration <b> Dt </b> is set by clicking on (D) and
chjanging it.  If  <b> Dt </b> is negative, then the program
integrates bakwards in time. The default is <b> Dt=0.05</b>. For this
simple problem, set <b> Dt=.2 </b> by clicking (D), typing .2, and
then (Enter).
<b> n(O)ut </b> is important as it tells
XPP how frequently you want output to plot and browse.  It is set to 1
by default thus, you will get output every 0.05 msec in these
examples. The <b> t(R)ansient </b> tells the program how long to
integrate before saving and plotting the numbers.  This is useful for
integrating out transient effects.  <b> Start time </b> tells the
integrator what the starting time is.  It is set to 0 by default and
is totally irrelevant for <i> autonoumous </i> differential equations
that do not have time explicitly in them. Finally, <b> Method </b> tells the
program which method to use to integrate the equations.  The default
is Runge-Kutta.  The <b> Gear </b> method is
uses an <i> adaptive
</i> step size.  It will integrate <i> stiff </i> differential
equations which are impossible to integrate using standard means.  It
is a very robust integrator. The <b> Stiff </b> integrator is another
integrator for stiff equations that uses adaptive stepping.  The best
general purpose integrator is the Quality Step Runge-Kutta which works
for most nonstiff equations and is adaptive.
  The other integrators are well-known and
can be found in any book on numerical methods.  <b> Modified Euler
</b> is sometimes called Heun's method.  

<p> Having set the global bounds and the total integration time,
return to the main menu by clicking (Esc). Set the window size by
clicking (W) (W) to bring up the <a href=xppmain.html#wind> window </a>
box. Change it so that the
X-axis goes from 0 to 200 and the y-axis from -150 to 150.  Click on
(Ok) or type (Tab) to enter the results.  Type (I) (G) to <a
href=xppmain.html#ics> integrate </a>
the equations.  You should see a straight line across the screen.  We
started essentially at rest.  Now type (I) (N) to manually enter new
initial conditions. You will be asked for the initial voltage.  Type
in  -20.  You should see a decay to the rest state just like you saw
in the linear problem. Now start with initial data of V=-10. Click (I)
(N) again and then type in -10.  <i> Aha! </i> the voltage does not
decay; instead it increases to a new level of around 50 mV. This is an
example of multi-stability.  <i> Nonlinear systems are often
characterized by the existence of multiple stable behaviors. </i>
This cannot happen with linear differential equations (unless they are
<a href=gif/texasch.gif> degenerate </a>.) <p>


 

<h2> <a name=newwind> Making another window </a> <p> </h2>
Lets look at the calcium current. Create a  new window
by clicking (M) (C).  This invokes the <a
href=xppmain.html#half>  Make Window </a> 
command. (For old versions, the command is Half Window,
 a <a href=gif/3stooges.gif> stupid </a> name that is a
holdover from the DOS version where the window was split in half.)
Grab the lower corner of the window and make it larger.  Note that the
window has a small square in the upper left corner that tells you it
is the current plotting window.  It also has a strip across the top
that gives the x-y coordinates when you move the mouse within the
window with the button down. Now in the main window click (X) to
choose what to plot versus time and type ICA (Enter) at the prompt.
Recall that ICA is the name you gave the calcium current.  You will
see the calcium current plotted in the new window as a function of
time.  Note that it is negative and so it is an inward current.  
To make the voltage window the active plotting window, click the mouse
inside the graph and the little square will show up on the voltage
window.  Make the calcium window active again.  Now click the mouse
button somewhere in the picture and move it around. Look at the
region above the picture.  You should see a pair of numbers that indicate
the point on the graph where you move.  This is how you can figure
out approximate values of points on your graphs. Find the time at
which the calcium current is most negative. (It is about -4.7 msec.)  

<h3> <a name=hw1.5> Homework 1.5 </h3> <p>
Make the voltage window the plotting window by clicking on it.
You saw above that if you start with V=-20 then the voltage goes to an
equilibrium value of about -60.  If you start with V=-10 it goes to a
high voltage of about 60 mV.  This suggests that between -20 and -10
there is a critical value of voltage which acts as a threshold and any
potential below threshold goes to the low state and above goes to the
high state.  Find this value, <b> V* </b>  Then use the (S) (G) option to find the 
<a href=xppmain.html#sing> <b> singular point </b> or <b> equilibrium
</b></a> value of voltage that is the threshold.  (Answer <b> No </b>
to both questions that XPP asks. ) Is this stable?
Such a point separates the set of initial voltages into two groups:
(i) those which tend to the lower voltage  <i> V &lt V* </i> and (ii)
those which tend to the upper voltage <i>V &gt V* </i>.  These two
half lines are called <b> the domain of attraction </b> of the lower
and upper equilibria.  
<p>

<h2> <a name=auto> AUTO for the first time </a> </h2>

One of the main goals of nonlinear dynamics is the study of how
systems depend on parameters.  The study of the parametric dependence
of differential equations is called <b> continuation </b> and the
analysis of how solutions appear and disappear as parameters vary is
called <b> bifurcation theory </b> from the Latin word <i> bifurkus
</i> for branching. 
<p>
The program <a href=xppauto.html> <b> AUTO </b> </a> 
 is one of the best continuation packages
available and allows you to study the behavior of nonlinear dynamical
systems as a function of parameters.  It is part of XPP so that you
can easily go between the two programs.  The interface to regular AUTO
involves writing lots of different FORTRAN programs, compiling them,
and then running them.  In this version, everything is done
interactively.  
<p>
To use AUTO you have to <a href=xppauto.html#prep><b> prepare </b>
</a> your file by starting at a known
steady state.  When <i> I=0 </i> the lower steady state is -59.446.
Thus start an integration with V(0)=-59.446.  (I) (N) and enter the
voltage at the prompt. Now you have a good guess for a steady state.
Click (F) (A) to bring up the AUTO window. You will see a window like
this:
<p>
<center> <img src=gif/auto.gif> </center> </p>
There are 4 regions in the window.  A majority of it is taken up by
the main graphics window where the bifurcation diagram is drawn.
Below this is the information window.  This is used when you have
found the bifurcation window and are traversing the different
branches.  It tells you about stability of the branch, the values of
the parameters, and the nature of <a href=xppauto.html#special> <b>
special points.</b></a> the left are the menus which let you tell AUTO
<ul>
<li> The <a href=xppauto.html#choose> <b> parameters </b> </a> you want to
vary
<li> The dimensions and what you want to plot on the <a
href=xppauto.html#axes> <b> axes </b> </a>
<li> The <a href=xppauto.html#numer> <b> numerical </a> </b>
parameters that control AUTO
<li> <a href=xppauto.html#user> <b> User defined </b></a> special
points at, say, a particular period or value of a parameter
<li> What to <a href=xppauto.html#save> <b> save </b> </a> such as the
graph of the diagram, the actual orbits, etc.
<li> When to <a href=xppauto.html#abort> <b> ABORT </b> </a> a calculation
</ul>
<p> Finally, the little square with a circle in it summarizes the
<a href=xppauto.html#run> <b> stability </b> </a> 
 information of the solutions.  All stable modes lie in the circle and
unstable ones out of the circle.    
<p> <center> <img src=gif/rainbowline.gif> </center> <p>
Assuming you are still with me, we will now use AUTO to compute the
steady state voltage as a function of the current.  (This can be done
by hand since this is a scalar differential equation.  Thus, it might
seem that we are killing a <img src=gif/spider2.gif> with a shotgun.
However, the basic method we use here can be easily used for other
problems. )<p>
You should have set the initial data for the voltage to <i> V=50.446
</i> and the current <i> I=0. </i>   All other paremeters should be at
their default values.  (To make sure of this, go to the main XPP
window and type (P).  At the <b> Parameter </b> prompt, type the word
<b> default </b> and the parameters will be set to their originals.)
<p>
Now click the AUTO window so that it is active.  Click on the
(Parameter) window and you will see a list of 5 parameters.  These are
the parameters that AUTO will recognize.  We want to vary the current,
<b> I </b> and since the
current <b> I </b> is among these parameters, we don't have to change
anything.  Just click on (Ok). 
<p>
Next, we want to set up the ranges of the diagram for plotting.  Click
on (Axes) and a menu will appear.  We want to plot the maximum and
minimum of the voltage versus the parameter, so we choose the default
of <b> HiLo. </b> A new window will appear into which we type the
necessary information.  We want the "Y axis" to be the voltage, so we
should type <b> V </b> for that entry.  The main parameter is the
current so change  <b> VL </b> to <b> I </b>.  We want the current to
vary from -225 to 60 so use these values for <b> Xmin </b> and <b>
Xmax </b> respectively.  Finally, the voltage will range from -200 to
100 so type in these values for <b> Ymin </b> and <b> Ymax </b>
respectively and then click on (Ok).  Summarizing, the entries of
interest should look like this:
<ul>
<li> Y axis: V 
<li> Main Par. : I
<li> Xmin: -225
<li> Ymin: -200
<li> Xmax: 60
<li> Ymax: 100
</ul>
(<i> How did I know what range?
</i> I ran this diagram extending the ranges until I got the full
picture. Thus, <i> practice and playing around are the best
tools. </i>)  
<p> Now, AUTO needs to know some numerical stuff.  Click on (Numerics)
and a window comes up with many entries.  Look at <a
href=xppauto.html#numer> the numerical </a> description in the <a
href=xppaut.html> AUTO </a> part of this tutorial.  For now make sure
of the following :
<ul>
<li> Ds = .02
<li> Dsmax = 5.0
<li> Par Min = -220
<li> Par Max = 50
<li> Norm Max = 1000
</ul>
and then click on (OK).  You are ready to roll!  Click on (Run) and
then click on (Steady state).  If you did it right, you will be
rewarded with the diagram:
<p>
<center>
<img src=gif/diag1.gif> </center> <p>
<img align=left src=gif/bangbang.gif> <i> If you did not get this, then
you should  try again.  Reset the diagram
by clicking (File) (Reset Diagram) and answering yes.  Go back to the
main  <b> XPP </b> window and reset the initial data to V=-59.446 and
I=0. Then repeat the above steps.  </i>
<p>
Assuming that you now have the diagram, lets <a
href=xppauto.html#grab> traverse </a> the diagram to see what we have
computed.  Click on (Grab) and a cross-hair should appear on your
diagram.  (<i> NOTE </i> If you do not
see a cross-hair then you should run XPP with the -xorfix option.
That is, XPP should call xppaut -xorfix instead of just xppaut See the
documentation for details.)   
Use the left and right arrow keys to move along the diagram.
As you move, the information window at the bottom tells you stuff
about the solutions such as the parameter values, the voltage value
and the value of a secondary parameter.  As you move along the
diagram, the stability is displayed in the stability window. A quick
summary of stability is seen from the diagram itself.  <b>Thick solid 
lines indicate  stable fixed points </b> , <i> thin are unstable fixed points</i>.
<b> Solid circles are stable periodic solutions</b> and <i> open circles are
unstable periodics </i>. 
<p>
You can move through the diagram very rapidly by using the (TAB) key
which only jumps to the<a href=xppauto.html#special> <b>
special points.</b></a>  When you grab a <b> special </b> point, then
you can do lots of other things with AUTO.  Move to the point labeled
1.  We will continue this curve in the negative <b> I </b> direction.
Press the (Enter) key to accept this point.  (When you (Enter) on a
grabbed point, it sets all the dependent variables to the
corresponding values and the relevant parameters to their values.  If
the point is a <b> special </b> point, it 
also tells AUTO information about the nature of the point. )  Now we
have "grabbed" the starting point in our curve.  AUTO has already
traced out the curve in the positive I diresction.  Click on the
(Numerics) menu again.  In the slot labeled <b> Ds </b> change  <b> 0.02
to -.02 </b> so that AUTO will try to go in the other direction. Click
on (Ok) to leave the numerics window and click on (Run).  A branch
should appear that continues until around I=-220.  It is solid.  <p>
This is a complete diagram of the voltage-current relationship.  There
are two interesting values of the current.  Traverse the diagram by
clicking (Grab) and moving the crosshairs.  The special point labeled
<b> 2 </b> is denoted in the information window as <b> LP </b> meaning
that it is a limit point.  It occurs at <i> I=36.79 </i>  A similar
point at <i> I=-210.5 </i> is also a limit point.  Both of these <b>
limit points </b> are also called <b> saddle-nodes </b> or <b> turning
point </b> bifurcations.  They represent values of the parameter at
which a pair of solutions comes together to form one solution.  Note
that the two values of current delimit the range in which there are
two stable possible voltages.  For <i> -210.5 &lt I &lt 36.8 </i>
there are three steady states, two of which are stable, separated by
an unstable steady state (cf. <a href=#hw1.5> Homework 1.5 </a>)  Thus
imagine you start at the lower steady state.  As you increase the
current, the voltage rises until you hit <i> I=36.8. </i> There is a
sudden increase in the potential from about -32 mV to +64mV.  Now
decrease the current.  The potential stays high until you cross <i>
I=-210.5 </i> at which point the potential drops precipitously.  The
appearance of two stable steady states gives rise to <i> this </i>
phenomena which is known as <b> hysteresis. </b>  <p>
<a name=oscil> <b> NOTE </b> </a>  This hysteresis in the <i> I-V </i> curve is essential
for neurons and one can see how it is then possible to get oscillatory
behavior.  Indeed, suppose that we make the current a varible such
that when the voltage is low, the current increases and when it is
high, it decreases.  Then the voltage will oscillate making up and
down jumps at the limit points. <p>
<h3> <a name="cusp"> Two parameter curves and the "Cusp catastrophe"
</a>
</h3> <p>
AUTO (and XPP) allow you to study two parameter curves of special
points.  That is, we have seen that for <i> GCA=4 </i> there are
limit points at <i> I=36.8,-210.5. </i>  What about <i> GCA=3 </i> or
other values of GCA.  We could of course, change GCA and redo this
calculation.  Instead, we can fix our attention to the limit point and
just compute the values of I for each value of GCA at which there is a
limit point. Lets do that now.  Grab special point number 2.  (Click
(Grab) and (Tab) to it, then hit (Enter).) Click on (Axes and choose
(Two par) to do a two parameter bifurcation.  We will look at the
appearance of limit points for <i> 0 &lt GCA &lt 10 </i> and extend
the current to a slightly more positive value. 
<ul> 
<li> Change the entries inthe Axis window to:
<ul>
<li> Y-axis : V
<li> Main Parm: I
<li> 2nd Parm: gca
<li> Xmin: -225
<li> Ymin: 0
<li> Xmax: 100
<li> Ymax: 10
</ul>
<li> Click (Ok) after making these changes.  In two parameter bifurcations,
the "Y-axis" entry is ignored and just "2nd Parm" entry becomes the
Y-axis for the graph.  
<li> Now click on (Numerics) and change (Par Max) to
100. Click (Ok) and we are ready to roll.  
<li> Click on (Run) and a thinline that runs off the screen will
appear. This is a curve of values
of (I,GCA) at which there is a limit point. 
<li>  Now focus on the
information window and click (Grab) until you once again are on
special point 2 (You wont see anything on the graph which is why I
told you to focus on the info window.)  
Type (Enter) to accept the point.  
<li> Click on (Numerics) and then change <b> Ds from -.02 to
0.2 </b> and then click on (Ok.)  
<li> Now click on (Run) and the branch
will continue down and to the right until it stops.  This is the
"complete" curve of (I,GCA) points corresponding to the first limit point..
</ul>
<p>
Now, we want to do this for the other limit point, special point 4.
<ul>
<li> Click on (Grab) and (Tab) 3 times to get special point 4 and type
(Enter) to accept it.
<li> <i> Now before starting, note that you may want to click on <b>
(ABORT) </b> while the curve is running as it gets numerically
treacherous near the end. </i> Thus, if you see a build-up of lots of
numbers, click on the (ABORT).  Now click on (Run) and the other
branch will appear. Click on (ABORT) to stop the calculation.
</ul>
If you have done this correctly, you will see something like<p>
<center>
<img src=gif/cusp.gif> </center> <p>
The two branches of limit points meet at a cusp point.  Within the
region bounded by the two curves, there are <b> three </b> rest states
and outside of them there is <b> one. </b>   A three-dimensional
representation of this looks like:
<p><center><img src=gif/cusp3d.gif> </center><p>
<p>
This completes the analysis of a model with a single nonlinear
conductance. You should click on (File)  (Reset Diagram) and click
(Yes) at the prompt.  This will delete all the files that AUTO creates
when running a bifurcation diagram

A one-dimensional neural net is described by the following equations:
